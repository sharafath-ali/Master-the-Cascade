This repository contains a series of tasks designed to help you master CSS Flexbox with practical exercises.

## Task 2: Responsive Pricing Table

### Goal
Create a **responsive pricing table** using Flexbox with the following requirements:

### Requirements
- Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file.
- The layout should have:
  1. A **header** with the title "Choose Your Plan".
  2. Three **pricing cards** arranged side by side on larger screens and stacked on smaller screens.
  3. Each card should include:
     - A title (e.g., "Basic", "Pro", "Premium").
     - Price.
     - A list of features.
     - A call-to-action button.
- Use Flexbox to:
  - Align cards evenly in a row on large screens.
  - Stack them vertically on small screens.
  - Ensure equal height for all pricing cards.

### Expected Output
- The pricing cards should be neatly aligned on desktop.
- They should stack properly on smaller screens.
- Buttons should have a hover effect.

### Bonus
- Add a smooth hover effect that slightly scales up a card when hovered.
- Add a highlight effect to the "Pro" plan to make it stand out.

### Submission
