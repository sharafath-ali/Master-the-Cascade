# Advanced Flexbox Challenge – Asymmetrical Layout

## 📌 Goal
Create a responsive **asymmetrical layout** using **Flexbox** that changes drastically on different screen sizes.

## 🛠 Task Requirements
### **1️⃣ Create a 3-section layout**
- **Sections:**
  - `Sidebar`
  - `Content`
  - `Extra Section`

### **2️⃣ Layout Behavior Based on Screen Size**
- **Desktop View (Large Screens)**:
  - Sidebar on the **left** (takes up 20% width).
  - Content in the **center** (takes up 60% width).
  - Extra section on the **right** (takes up 20% width).

- **Tablet View (Medium Screens)**:
  - Sidebar **moves to the top** (full width).
  - Content and Extra section **stack side by side (50% each)**.

- **Mobile View (Small Screens)**:
  - All sections **stack vertically**.
  - Change the **order** so the Extra section appears **before** Content.

## 🔹 Flexbox Concepts to Use
✅ `display: flex` for the main container.  
✅ `flex: 1`, `flex: 2`, etc., to control the section sizes.  
✅ `order` to **rearrange** sections on smaller screens.  
✅ `flex-wrap: wrap` for responsiveness.  
✅ `align-items` & `justify-content` for better alignment.  
✅ Media queries for **different layouts on different screen sizes**.  

## 💡 Extra Challenge
1. Add **hover effects** to sections for better UI.  
2. Experiment with **min-width and max-width** in combination with Flexbox.
