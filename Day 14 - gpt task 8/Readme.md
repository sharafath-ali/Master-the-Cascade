### **Task 3: Responsive Testimonial Section**
#### **Goal**
Create a **testimonial section** using Flexbox with proper responsiveness.

#### **Requirements**
- Create a new `index.html` and `style.css` file (or extend your existing project).
- The section should contain:
  1. A **heading**: "What Our Customers Say".
  2. Three **testimonial cards** (name, image, and a short review).
  3. A **flexible layout**:
     - On **large screens**, cards should be in a row.
     - On **small screens**, they should stack vertically.
- Use **Flexbox** to:
  - Align the testimonials evenly in a row.
  - Ensure equal height for all testimonial cards.
  - Adjust layout for responsiveness.

#### **Expected Output**
- The section should look clean and professional.
- The testimonials should be neatly aligned.
- Cards should have a hover effect (e.g., slight scale-up).

#### **Bonus**
- Add a subtle **fade-in effect** when scrolling.
- Use **CSS Grid** instead of Flexbox and compare.

#### **Submission**
- Push your code to your Git repository.
- Share the link with me once done.
