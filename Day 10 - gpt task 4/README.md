# Task #4: Responsive Sidebar with Flexbox

## 🎯 Goal
Create a **responsive sidebar layout** where the sidebar and main content are displayed side by side on larger screens and stacked on smaller screens.

## 📌 Requirements
- The sidebar should be **30% width** and the main content **70% width** on large screens.
- Use `display: flex;` to arrange them side by side.
- On screens **below 600px**, the sidebar should take **full width** and stack on top.
- The sidebar and main content should have **different background colors**.
- Center the text inside both sections.

## 📂 Files
- `index.html` (HTML structure)
- `style.css` (CSS styling)

## ✅ Expected Behavior
- 🖥️ **Large screens:** Sidebar on the left, content on the right.
- 📱 **Small screens (<600px):** Sidebar moves on top, full width.

## 💡 Hints
- Use `flex-direction: column;` inside a `@media` query to stack the sections.
- `min-width: 600px` can be used for breakpoints.
- Experiment with `flex-basis` to control the sidebar width.
