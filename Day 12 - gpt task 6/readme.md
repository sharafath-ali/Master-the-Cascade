# Flexbox Mastery Tasks

This repository contains a series of tasks designed to help you master CSS Flexbox with practical exercises.

## Task 1: Advanced Flexbox Layout

### Goal
Create a responsive **dashboard layout** using Flexbox with the following requirements:

### Requirements
- Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file.
- The layout should have:
  1. A **header** (full-width, fixed height).
  2. A **sidebar** (fixed width on large screens, collapsible on small screens).
  3. A **main content area** (flex-grow to take available space).
  4. A **footer** (full-width, fixed height).
- Use Flexbox to:
  - Make the sidebar stick to the left with `flex-shrink: 0`.
  - Allow the main content to expand dynamically.
  - Ensure the layout is **fully responsive**, collapsing the sidebar into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

### Expected Output
- A fully responsive dashboard layout.
- Sidebar should collapse into a menu icon on smaller screens.
- The main content should take all available space when sidebar is collapsed.

### Bonus
- Add a simple animation to toggle the sidebar.

### Submission
- Upload your code to a Git repository.
- Share the link with me once done!
